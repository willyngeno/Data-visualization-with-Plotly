  Discusion  on  Data  visualization  with  python  and  its  libraries
  
  Emannuella  is  joining  us  all  the  way  from  france paris and  i  started  in  particular contributing  to  psychic image  which is  a  python image  processing  toolkit.Since  i  was  using  it  for  my  research and  one  year  and  half  ago i  decided to contribute  more  to  open  sources and  this  is  way  i  join  blockely full  time  and  during this  time at  plotely i've  been lucky  to  receive  a  grant  from a  chance  working  bag  initiative   which  is  a  foundation   which  has  funded  a project bloodly  to  work  on interactive  image  processing. I  talk it  at  the  end  of  presentation so  the  subject of  my  talk  is  bloodly  graphic  library.So what  is  Plotly, maybe  most  of  you know  about  it and  i'll  try to  share a little  just so  that you  can vote for  your  prefered    visualization  tool.You  don't  have  to  say it's  bloodline.It  is  just  interesting for  me  to see   which  tool  people  are  using.I  just  put  solution well, just put  solution  answers in  writing  because  this is  the  language  i know  the most  but  so  plotly is  a  web  native  visualization  library and  since it is  developed   for  visualization  in  the browser  it is  written  in  javascript but  it  also as  apis for  language  more  familiar  to  data  scientist.So  python are and  more  recenlty  julia  as  well  the  python  flavor of plotly also  as  a  high level expressive api which  is called bloody   express  and  which  is  particularly  suitable for  working  with  spender's   data  frame  like  seabourn  for mad  bloodly  and for   python  plotting in  fact the most downloaded visualization library  which is  interactive that  is  web  based and  very  interactive matplotlib is  more  than  loaded  but  then it's  not  as  interactive  and it's  not  based  plotly.Is  a  open  source  it's  mightly  licensed  and  during  this presentation  we'll  see  that  it  has a  large variety  of  traces  and is  very  customizable  and  it  has  a  strong  focus  on interactivity in  the  sense  that  charts  figures  are very  interactive but  also  they  send  events  which  can  be  listened  to  by  other  libraries for  even  more  interactivity .So  in  order  to  illustrate  capability  of  properly  i'll  focus here on  three  different  use  case  of  bloodly  during  this  talk  first of  all  we  will  see  how to  explore data  by  visualizing them  which  is something you can do in  jupyter  notebook for  example ,the i'll  switch  to a slightly  more  advanced  use case  where you  want  your  visualization  to  interact with  other  elements or to publish them as a dashboard and  finally i'll  combine the  two  first  aspects to  show tools we've been  developing recently for interactive image annotation and  processing.So let  me  start with  the  first  use case  which  is  interactive  exploration of  data and  for  this  we'll   work  on a  notebook.S  i  guess  most  of  you  are  familiar  with  jupyter  notebook,it's  development  environment  which  is  mixes  code cells  and the  outputs.So  i'll  be  using  it  during  this  presentation.I hope  the  fonts are  big  enough,i  can  increase  them  a  bit so  plotly is  open  source  you can paper  install  it  and  so we'll  start by  importing  it  and  in particular  we'll  import  a  set  package  called   graph objects  for  it's  like  a collection of  graphical  objects  and it's  commonly  imported  as go  and  the first  we'll  be  creating  is  called graph  object  and  so  when  we  execute  this  in a  notebook  we  get a  figure but  then  its an  empty  figure.So  not  very  interesting  but we'll  populate this  figure  object in  an  object-oriented  manner  by  adding  first a  trace  which will be  a  scatter  trace  with  x and  y  coordinates.Okay  and  we'll  show  it  the  first  race  and  we'll  add  more  elements by  adding  for  example  a  bar  plot so  a second  trace   and let's  say  we  don't .So traces are  data  points  which  you  are  visualizing  in some  specific  ways  and  here  we  also  want  to  add  more elements,in particular  let's say  we  want to  add  a  title  is a  part  of what is  called  the  layout  in a  closely  figure  and so we   call the  update  layout  method  my first  figure this will  be  my  text  okay.So  here  is our first  figure  object but   what  is it exactly.To  know  what  is  this figure  exactly  we  will  print  to  show  the its  structure  calling  its  representation.So we  see   that  this  figure object   contains  an  object which  looks  like a  dictionary, which  is  a  dictionary  of  dictionaries.So  it  as  a  nested  hierarchy  structure  with  different  properties  and  attributes  of  the  visual  elements  and  this  object  is  in  fact passed  to  javascript  library  as  a  json  string  since  it  as  this  json-like  hierarchy.So  its in  fact a  very  simple object  which  is just  past  as  it  is  to javascript part  of  the  library  and  once  you  have  understood  this  nested  hierarchical  structure  then  you  can  you  can   modify  it  like for  example  if i want  my  first  trace   which  is  the  scatter trace. I  want  to  modify its  x coordinate not  0 1 2  but  1 2 3. I  can  modify  it this  way  you  see  it  as  shifted  x  data points or  i can  modify  my  title (Music) like  this  equal  to  30.Okay  but  instead of  writing  all  those  dots  its  actually  nicer  to  call  this  high  level   methods of  the figure objects  which are  archways or update  traces, update layout  and  also  instead of  writing  all  these  dots  you  see  here  this  underscore  which  is exactly  the  same  us   putting the dot  here.So  if  i  want to  modify  the  title  font  size  here  i  can  write  it  like  this  so  using this   underscore   called  magic  underscores.A way  to  navigate  down  the  hierarchy  of  attributes  of  the  plotly  figure .There  you  go.Okay  so  this  for  a crash  course.Introduction to the  structure  of  bloodly  figures you  can  create  figures  in this  informative  way  where  you define  the traces.You modify the layout and you create a figure., but sometimes it's much nicer to  use a high level api and this is  what the plotly express  package does.So now i'll introduce plotly express you usually import it as px and  so it's probably express why express it's  in order to create a function figures fast but also to also to create figures in an expressive way so it's both fast and expressive and so px comes with a set of built-in data sets so we'll use one of them which is called the gapminder [Music]. It  is a painless data frame where each line is a pair of country in year and there are other columns for values such as the life expectancy or the population of the country for this year.S o  startwith we'll limit,our data sets to the most recent year here using some typical pandas syntax with a query and we'll start by asking ourselves what is the distribution of life expectancies through the countries of the world so we'll call the  express or px that a histogram function in order to plot a histogram so the syntax is you have the data frame and then you give the variable on which you want you to plot the distribution.So here i'm interested in the distribution of life expectancy there you go so you've got this figure which is [Music] quite interactive you can see in particular that i can see for each binder the count corresponding to the number of countries with life expectancy in a given bin what's interesting is that you can see that this histogram is quite bi-modal it's not just one peak. You can see that  a few countries have a very low life expectancy all those very high so can we know more about which countries are in which to pin for this we can add more visual elements but first i'd like to show you that this figure created by the plotliexpress core the plot express function is not very different from  the figures we've been using uh in the examples. Just before with graphical object so we'll print the figure and you can see that so it's still a figure object with a data key corresponding here to one trace this trace is a histogram so it's a graphical object trace it has some x data and also it has a layout which is populated with some values in particular  the title of   the access is already [Music] specified you don't have to give it yourself.So plotly express is here a fast way to produce a figure which is not completely camera ready but has already a lot of useful elements but it's exactly the same structure as a plotline figure created with graph objects and so i was saying what if we want to know more about which countries are in each bin then we can add facets for a marginal view of the countries so we add this rock plot where each of these small bars correspond to one country but we don't know the name of the countries so we'll map the name the country column of the data set to the hover name so that it appears in the hover [Music]. What  i'm doing here is mapping columns of my data set to visual elements and i can go further in this direction by adding a different color for different continents color equals continent [Music]. So here you've got this different stacked histograms each one of them corresponds to a different continent one interesting things also is this legend which is interactive like if i want to select only  asian country then i should double click on it or i can select or remove one of these continents so  the legend is quite quite useful .So this was for a histogram but in this histogram each country has the same weight whereas we know that some countries are much more populated than others so if you want a different view what we can do is instead to plot a bar plot with this time [Music] the x corresponding to  the continent and  to the population and you get this bar plot and where the height of each bar corresponds to to the population and this time since i've got a different  x  location for each continent i can save the color for a different colon of my data set which is life expectancy so that it will be color coded,color coding the life expectancy and you get this nice hues for the life expectancy with a color bar here so this chart is interesting but what if i want to be able to select one continent and to do some drill down in my data set for this i can switch from a bar plot to a more hierarchical plot and i will show you this by just looking through the  documentation. Just to show you an example of how to look for stuff in the  documentation so this is the main  documentation and let's say you're looking for a hierarchical plot so you see that on the left column you have the documentation results for different tutorials and here is a figure reference result so it's more of  api .So you see that the first results are treemap and some burst charts so which are the two kinds of hierarchical traces which we have in bloodley so if you go to one of these pages you have actually quite a large number of examples for each chart. You can see that there is a property express sunburst function that its arguments are pass for the hierarchy of levels values is what you want to represent the equivalent of the y in the bar chart  you have more examples with scholars  and so on and so forth so we try to have quite a thorough documentation for  and it's also an area where we get a lot of help from the community of users with a lot of community pro requests about improving the documentation which is absolutely great and i hope we continue to have a lot of great contributions from the community in the future but so if i go back to my code cell here, if i want to plot a sunburst here instead i have to use a bus with continent and then country [Music] and my values will be the population and color life expectancy. So i get this circular diagram where i can drill down in one country and you can see that in more details the different countries of africa and you can go back one level up by double clicking exploring another continent.So this is a small example of the entire activity which you you get with plotly and by the way the sunburst and tree map charts are even more useful when you have a large number of levels like three or four rather than two . So this was for a short introduction  to the  visualization library  one little thing which i can also show is how to  map different columns   not a two to facets that is two different subplots this is something which is very very useful so i could do like a live [Music] equals continent [Music] it's why okay so in this visualization i get  one facet per continent and i could also make different colors for just two [Music].  This is better so it's  also a way to map the values of your columns this time to a different subplots and this is a very powerful way of creating subplots and populating them because if you had to write all this yourself it's actually a bit more verbose you would have to loop through the different  facets. You can do it of course it's easy to write loose with python but  this high-level way of making multi-faceted plots is quite nice so this was for the short not so short maybe introduction to  plotline and if you want to learn more i recommend going to the documentation website which has several tutorials covering what i've been describing and in particular how to create figures their structure  express and you can also see in the documentation that there is a very large number of charts of course . Usual basic charts like pie charts bar charts but also statistical charts , heat maps, geographical charts ,3d visualization is also quite interesting so check it out if you're interested so very nice flats a lot of different traces but what if you want to have more interaction than just user interaction in one figure for example if you want to have two figures which interact together. So this is something which you can do with  plotline because plotting figures in fact emit some events which can be captured by other javascript tools and in particular you can capture these events using dash .So i spent just a few minutes explaining what is dash which is another open source library developed by  also mighty license.So dash is a web framework to write what we call analytical apps in python we'll see examples of analytical apps which are basically dashboards for science and data science it's a user interface toolkit so written in javascript but with a python api so that you can write your java your dashboards  in pure python with no javascript required. This is really the promise of dash it has a large variety of interactive components and so we will see  first a few examples just to introduce dash and then we'll see how plot integrates with dash.So we've got this first hello world  script for dash  where you import some dash modules and then you create your first dash app and you declare the layout of the app with several elements so one of them is an html title and the other one is taken from this dashboard  components library  which is for elements to be modified by the user and here it's a text input. so what happens if i execute this writing script we'll go back to the notebook just in a few minutes but just i show you the vanilla classical way of defining  dash apps. so when you run the app  under the hood there's a flask server running and you can go to a url where you have created your web page with this title you defined in layout and also a text input so far so good but we don't have interaction in this app so for interaction we need to add what's called a callback.So a callback is a this function decorated here which links together two components, here it takes as input the the text input when it's changed the callback will be triggered  as output  the content of my title. So what if i run this time this new app , this will   reload my app and now when i write hello every time i type a keystroke then the values are sent to the python server the callback is executed and the new value for the title is sent back to the javascript layer in my browser and if you want to take a look at the graph of callbacks in my  dash app you can see that here there is one callback linking together the input and the title components. Okay, so how can we integrate this with  graphs, so for this i first show you an example of what is it ,it's here which is an example from the dash gallery so in this dcc dash core components package you have a component called dcc.Graph which is a wrapper around the  figure and for example this is here a plotly figure you can see here it's modbar it's a different kind of trace which is  a cover plate. So it's one of this geographical  map and so when you change the sliders this will modify your map because there's a callback taking as input as a slider and as outputs a plotly figure.The callback creates a new plot re-figure and sends it to the browser.However  this is only one way of interacting and the other way works as well like if i make a selection like this lasting selection, here in my figure this will send a specific event called a selected event in to a callback listening to this kind of event and this will modify a histogram here so the plotline figure can be interacted with really both ways in a dash app you can modify it with a callback but it can also trigger events and callbacks and if you want to know more about the kind of events which you can listen to i encourage you to take a look at the the interactive visualizations tutorial of the dash documentation where you have this app with one callback for every kind of event.So hover over data which is the events triggered when you hover click data when you click selected data and so on and so forth and the layout data is when you change one element of the layout.So for example here if i zoom i will trigger a layout data event changing the range of the two axis or if i click i trigger also a click data event .so this is how you can connect plotly figures to other parts of a dash app so this was for a very short demonstration demo of how you can use your plotter figures in an interactive way with other elements in an app like a dash app and in the last part of my talk i'll show you how to combine platy express with  dash for image processing. So image processing is  what's the topic which  maybe interests me the most in data science.In scientific writing it's the task of processing your image data in order to extract information from them it's something which is done in a very large variety of domains in science like in biology where you want to count cells and measure the properties satellite imaging. It will be very useful also in a self-driving cars or in image classification like in google images for example and last year i've been working on this project funded by sensody in order to develop more tools for interactive image processing using several mainstream tools from scientific python. The first one is psychic image which is the image processing toolkit for python so i'm a maintainer also psyched image which is a collection of image processing algorithms with a functional api. You call functions on images and the idea of this project is to combine the algorithms of site image with the capabilities of plotting dash to use  in order to visualize image data in a dash  to trigger callbacks when you annotate images within plotline dash to call some algorithms from psychic image like if you draw a rough contour like here of this organ you want a psychic image to segment in a very good way,it's exact contour so the idea is to have powerful tools to build interactive image passing apps .So  how have we been doing this, let me go back to my notebook a first step has been to extend the plotly express api so that it had image visualization capabilities because we used to have limited capabilities for image visualization. So i'll start by just importing an image data set from  from psychic image, so sorry by calling one of the built-in image data sets which is the cat and [Music] there is one trace which is called image trace and which is meant to represent images [Music] i forgot to import  that's a demo effect [Music].So there you go, you've got this image visualization here in this figure where you've got some information in the hover in particular  the value of each pixel is represented as z here this is quite useful and so that's a low level go api but we've also introduced the corresponding property express function and we've got a px dot in show [Music] function [Music] and  [Music] which is calling  an image trace under the hood.So this  first step of the project was to  implement this interactive image visualization function where you can zoom ;you can select some parts and now we can build our first image processing dash app. For this i'll reuse some code so that you don't have to see me copy pasting.So let's say i want to [Music] visualize the histogram of some parts in my image and i want the user to select interactively some interesting parts. So for  this since, we are in the notebook i'd be using a recent,let me  use a new notebook we'll be using a new package called jupiter dash [Music] which we've been releasing and oh, i forgot to kill  my old app. So i need to  use in a new port [Music], so jupiter dash is a way to display your  well  to write and visualize your dash apps in the notebook. So it's very convenient if you're used to working in the notebook because you can start just creating your plotly figures in the notebook and then adding some interactivity with the jupiter dash app. So here i've got two figures one of them is my image here and the other one is a histogram and i want to be able to make a selection and to see what happens what is the histogram of my  selected vision and so when you do this. Usually what i start doing is that i listen to the selected data event and i look at  the structure of this this events and i see that it looks like this so i know the syntax of  what i should be calling.I use print quite a lot in the dash apps and so this will be like my next  [Music] my next callback.Let me update it i see that i'm running out of time so i will try to be fast and just updating this [Music].So this time when i select a small region then the  graph is updated and if i select like the nose for example it's very red so i can explore some parts of  my image like this the white part is very bright and so on and so forth but  so with selection i can have some interactivity but selections are quite short-lived and we wanted to have something which  was more persistent in user annotations which you could use for a longer time in the plotlife and this is why we introduced  shapes. So shapes which you can draw  have been parts of the plotline layout for a long time.So a shape for example is this rectangle and in the most recent versions of  you can draw shapes yourself like for example you can draw a rectangle you can draw a circle and each time you do this this triggers a layout event you can also modify them just by clicking modifying some of them and you can listen to the corresponding  layout data events  in your  dash apps. So i just stopped the presentation by showing you a small example of a more advanced dash app. We've been writing using this annotation so this shape annotations we've got one figure here which would like to segment, that is to separate the different parts of the image in different classes ,and here when i'm selecting the different colors a callback is updating the new shape properties of my platfigure so that the the color is changed.I  will do this, i can also modify it switch which is another property of this new shapes and and so on and so i have all my shapes which are persistent more than selections and then when i click on this show segmentation a callback uses cyclone to compute well cyclotron and features corresponding on local neighborhoods to compute labels for the remaining pixels so this is an example combining these  annotations  in an interactive figure where you can also zoom for example you can fan and look at the details and also the power of scientific writing libraries like psychic image for image processing or psychic learn for machine learning.
  CONCLUSION  
So i'm running a bit out of time so conclude here by just hoping that this presentation was interesting for you i hope there will be questions in the chat i hope you will be in touch either on twitter or also we have this discourse community forum where a lot of questions about   and dash are asked and answered too. So thank you very much and i hope we'll now have a nice q a session thank you.So let me go back to the chat ,okay .So i guess it's your time to work and to ask questions in the chat so the next question  is image processing the same as neural networks or a different process.So neural networks are a possible tools for image processing because image processing is this generic class of tasks where you want to extract information from images and there are several ways of doing that; you can either do somewhere operations on  pixel values which is a more traditional way of doing image processing or you can build a neural net to perform some image processing tasks by  learning some structure out of your images or you can also use  more traditional tools  for machine learning like   the app. I showed at the end was you using a random forest classifier for example so this is not a neural net but this is still using machine learning so i'd say neural net is one of the possible tools for image posting and nowadays it's also the state of the art for a lot of image processing tasks like image classification or segmentation or some objects. Next question is  how is the app recognizing the classes,after you indicate the classes this is some kind of cnn or other machine learning algorithm so i went very quickly on this app because i was running out of time. So let me go back to the app so here  for each pixel  we call a circuit image function  computing a vector features for each pixel. So features are based on the local intensity the local standard deviation and texture in different neighborhoods with different signals. So we've got this vector features for each pixel and after we call  random forest classifier  from cyclic learn so it starts using cnn but the features are defined  in a more specific way but of course it would be also possible to use a pre-trained  neural nets here  which could give very good results maybe even better that's actually some extension i've been wanting  to do. To this ab it's to try it out with  with the neural net. Then the next question is does bloodley dash work well with 3d volumetric images both for visualization and image analysis so plotline has a variety of traces for 3d visualization i can show here the section of the documentation on the  3d  plots like is it has a surface plots  which it has  3d scatter plots  and so on and so forth. The performance of these traces depends on the size of your data sets like if for example you want to compute a nicer surface of several millions of points it can take quite a lot of time and it can even freeze your browser. So  usually you want to limit  the number of data points  which  you feed the browser since the browsers are not very good with very large objects but for medium sized data sets you've got all this nice traces which you can use. So for image processing in 3d in particular you can use slices or maybe i can show this up dash playground it's a recent app which we've been writing. So it's not using here a 3d trace but it's using  just slices through a 3d volume.So it's  an mri data set here so this is just a broadly image where here i'm navigating through the  different slices and so here  in this interactive dash app we want to segment here a lesion which is a part of the brain where there was a problem and so the segmentation is done. So you can see that this slicing and dicing through the volume works quite well so this is something you can do with splatling and you also have a 3d view here of the brain where  you have here  the lesion which has been segmented in 3d and the contour of the brain.So this is a typical example of what you've been doing in 3d with splatly so that was for the vince and as for the image analysis. So plotli does not include image processing algorithms but  if you're calling  its python api then you can use  other packages such as psycat image  for example so that  you can write callbacks which are just a few lines  calling  second image functions and this is what we've been doing in this since that project if you're interested i forgot to mention that we've got a blog which is  you can see it from my twitter i've tweeted a few blog posts with some examples  describing how to use  dash and circuit image together for  image processing and one of the next posts will be on the 3d visualization in image processing.So i think i went through the whole list of questions, i don't know if we still have time for one or two questions it's also possible of course to reach out after the webinar but the nice thing here is that other people can see the questions and hear the answers.Oh we can take a look also at the  results of the poll  but there is  one more question  which is basically a story of my life ,could you share your career trajectory from your PHD in physics to working on open source development full time, so during this year's in research i've been doing experiments where my main source of scientific data was images and i needed to extract some numbers, some scientific data from this large sets of images which i was acquiring at the synchrotrons and so and  for this is how i started contributing to psychic image because when i started doing image phosing a second image was actually just starting and  i got more and more involved because  well first of all the scientific writing is community. Is a very nice one very welcoming and i felt very welcomed so i wanted to spend more time in this community and also i realized the importance of having open source tools available to a large community because this was something i was directly using for  my research work.So i tried to spend some time on open source development but as a hobby and at some point i thought hey why don't you try to turn this hobby into a job and this is how i joined  which is this open core company  developing nice open source tools used by very large number of users with also a commercial offering but i've been working on the the open source tools and so at the end of  this grant i'm going back to to research but  it's been really great navigating  between research and software because  the  research software tools are just essential,you need them to do your science but also when you're developing software it's very useful to have ideas about what users can do and having my background in research having also collaborations and contacts students doing research has been very useful when developing software because it helps developing the right tools something which you think will be really used. So  i would encourage really people in research trying to spend more time developing open source software but also people developing software also trying to be in the shoes of their users and also to to work on applications so basically doing more multidisciplinary work. So thank you  for this question and for all the questions thank you thank you so much emma.I think that is the most successful live coding demo i have seen which is really great because you never know how these things well yeah only a few bucks it was really great. Thank you so much and for our  you know for people who are joining i'm gonna you know sort of  put a video up within the next few days and for sharing the notebook it won't be today because it's midnight in paris so bear with me in wait until tomorrow please yeah we'll definitely get that information out i'll probably add it as a link to the youtube video.So it's readily available for whoever watches versus an email or something so yeah i think that'll be great thank you very much to everybody it's been really fun uh giving this presentation and especially answering the question saying thanks for having a lot of questions and if you have more please reach out and on twitter or on the plotline community forum so see you there thanks a lot.
